## The Matilija Wilderness

As a part of my survey work in the Thomas Fire Scar for the [Santa Barbara Botanic Garden](https://sbbotanicgarden.org/conservation/our-impact/restoring-habitats/), I visited the Matilija Wilderness in 2020 and 2021. It's one of 10 wilderness areas in the Los Padres, and home to some gorgeous streams, cool plant communities, and peaceful backcountry camps. 

### The Landscape
The Matilija Wilderness is home to some of the headwater forks of Matilija Creek, a persistent stream that runs through the rugged landscape -- making it a great place to backpack or visit waterfalls. In 2020, I hiked the Matilija Canyon Trail to Matilija Falls, and in 2021, I hiked the North Fork Matilija Trail to Maple Camp, just below where the trail connects to the Cherry Canyon Forest Service Road.

On your way in, you'll pass by several private inholding properties, where the early summer roadside is covered with lovely blooming native plants -- recovering quickly from the charred skeletons left by the Thomas Fire.

In 2021, I camped at Middle Matilija Camp, a lovely creek-side spot that we had to ourselves, and was shaded by some towering (if burned out) trees.

### The Plants
Matilija has a gorgeous native plant named after it - the Matilija poppy! This species is also known as the "fried egg" flower, for obvious reasons.
