### The Matilija Wilderness

As a part of my survey hiking in the Thomas Fire Scar with the (Santa Barbara Botanic Garden)[https://sbbotanicgarden.org/conservation/our-impact/restoring-habitats/], I visited the Matilija Wilderness in 2020 and 2021. It's one of 10 wilderness areas in the Los Padres, and home to some gorgeous streams, plant communities, and backcountry camps.
