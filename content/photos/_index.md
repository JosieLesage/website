  Some of my favorite photos. I love getting out and capturing records of local biodiversity - you can find more of my photography on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=castillejajosie&verifiable=any).

** No content below YAML for the talk _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside talk/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
