  I’m a scientist, educator, and huge nerd. I love getting excited about nature and data, and helping other people get excited about those things too. 
  
  I have a Ph.D in Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Cruz (graduated 2020), and a B.S. of Aquatic Biology from the University of California, Santa Barbara (2013). I’m an ecologist by training, but have dabbled in botany, pedagogy, and data science.

  I’m pretty active on [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?place_id=any&user_id=castillejajosie&verifiable=any), and love getting involved in community science efforts.

  I’m currently living in Portland, Oregon with my partner, cat (Walter), and ball python (Steve), and teaching Environmental Studies at Clark College in Vancouver, WA.
