### Abstract

Coastal fog affects many California plant species and can be critically important to species that experience periodic drought. Drought-deciduous species in particular rely on water availability to maintain their leaves during the summer. To determine fog water use in drought-deciduous plants, this study manipulated access to fog drip and measured the water relations of the common shrub, *Artemisia californica*, near Santa Barbara, CA. Fog water availability increased plant water content but had no effect on pre-dawn xylem pressure potential. While climatic variability inhibits reliable fog input to *A. californica* in Santa Barbara, this species can use fog water opportunistically and benefits from large fog events during the summer drought.
