### Abstract

Restoration frequently aims to improve native species biodiversity at a
site, but practitioners have limited resources. In diverse ecosystems,
the selective use of certain guilds or species can come at the cost of
species that are more challenging to incorporate,resulting in the
overall homogenization of the ecosystem and a relative loss of
biodiversity. We surveyed practitioners who restore California prairies
to understand their use of native annual forbs, an important component
of the biodiversity in this ecosystem. We found that practitioners
preferentially planted native perennial species, mainly grasses. Despite
practitioners' recognition of the high conservation value of native
annual forbs, they were hesitant to include this guild in their planting
palettes because of high costs, low and unpredictable establishment, and
lack of seed. We recommend that California annual prairie forbs be
seeded in multiple years to enhance establishment, and that monitoring
targets be designed to better reflect the high variability in
interannual abundance of native annual forbs. These issues are not
unique to California prairie, and more broadly, restoration objectives
and research across a range of ecosystems should prioritize guilds that
are more challenging to establish but are of high conservation concern.

### Implications for Practice

-   Restoration goals, practices, and research should incorporate a
    fuller suite of species, including those that are more challenging
    to propagate and establish, such as annual forbs in California
    prairies.
-   Restoration objectives and monitoring should be tailored to reflect
    differences in life histories across plant guilds.
-   Practitioners can employ several techniques to reduce the cost and
    risk associated with planting native annual forbs, such as seeding
    or planting in subportions of larger restoration projects, in years
    with high expected precipitation, or over multiple years.
