### Abstract

Restoration frequently aims to improve native species biodiversity at a site, but practitioners have limited resources. In diverseecosystems, the selective use of certain guilds or species can come at the cost of species that are more challenging to incorporate,resulting in the overall homogenization of the ecosystem and a relative loss of biodiversity. We surveyed practitioners whorestore California prairies to understand their use of native annual forbs, an important component of the biodiversity in thisecosystem. We found that practitioners preferentially planted native perennial species, mainly grasses. Despite practitionersâ€™recognition of the high conservation value of native annual forbs, they were hesitant to include this guild in their plantingpalettes because of high costs, low and unpredictable establishment, and lack of seed. We recommend that California annualprairie forbs be seeded in multiple years to enhance establishment, and that monitoring targets be designed to better reflect thehigh variability in interannual abundance of native annual forbs. These issues are not unique to California prairie, and morebroadly, restoration objectives and research across a range of ecosystems should prioritize guilds that are more challenging toestablish but are of high conservation concern.

### Implications for Practice

- Restoration goals, practices, and research should incorpo-rate a fuller suite of species, including those that are morechallenging to propagate and establish, such as annualforbs in California prairies.
- Restoration objectives and monitoring should be tailoredto reflect differences in life histories across plant guilds.
- Practitioners can employ several techniques to reducethe cost and risk associated with planting native annualforbs, such as seeding or planting in subportions of largerrestoration projects, in years with high expected precipi-tation, or over multiple years.
