excerpt: "In Southern California shrublands, wildflowers proliferate after fire while native shrubs recover by resprouting or germinating from the soil seed bank. As climate change, increased development, and the spread of invasive species lead to more frequent wildfires, we may need to step in more often to help landscapes recover and maintain the benefits nature provides.

### Abstract

In Southern California, where wildfires are a natural part of our ecosystem, many native plants have adaptations that allow them to recover after a burn without human intervention. But this may be changing as climate, increased urban development, and the spread of invasive species lead to more frequent wildfires. As a result, humans may need to step in more often to help landscapes recover after a fire. At the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, we're working to better understand exactly where, how, and when to intervene in post-fire landscapes to make the greatest impact.
